# Weather-Report-Kotlin-App-Final_Project

## Introduction
This is the final project of the Android Mobile App Development Using Kotlin, Android Architectural Design Patterns, & Android Unit Testing courses taught in Information Technology Institute (ITI)'s 9-Month Professional Training Program -- Embedded Systems Track as a part of the intensive Android Automotive subfield under the supervision of Eng. Ahmed Mazen, Eng. Heba Ismail, and Eng. Yasmeen Hosny from Java Education & Technology Services (JETS) department. Additionally, since I wanted something more challenging, I took a quick detour and compiled AAOS 15 from source for my Raspberry Pi 4B and tested the application on it (more on that later). As a reference, until I talk more about it later, here is a quick overview on the app's features:

1. Colourful splashscreen.
2. Fetch current weather & forecast by GPS or through map coordinates.
3. Full Arabic language support.
4. Display weather data in multiple unit systems.
5. Scheduled updates every 14 hours.
6. Scheduled alarms that show notification and display over other apps.
7. Last but not least, since this app is a Jojo reference I pulled no punches when it came to that! From the app icon, the background, all the way to the alarm that plays Birdland.

## App Showcase
Here are some screenshots of the app. :)
